# Frontend Debugging & Integration Guide

## 1. Debug Empty NewsGrid (Frontend)
- **Goal:** Ensure the frontend NewsGrid displays data for 2025-04-18, which is present in MongoDB/S3.
- **Status:** ✅ **Complete** — The NewsGrid now displays images and headlines as expected. The short_id and time slot ID mapping between backend and frontend is canonical and consistent.
- **Where to look:**
  - `frontend/src/components/NewsGrid.tsx` (main grid logic)
  - `frontend/src/routes/Home.tsx` and `frontend/src/routes/Analysis.tsx` (route-level data fetching)
  - `frontend/src/services/` (API calls, e.g., `api.ts`)
  - `frontend/src/constants/timeSlots.ts` (time slot mapping)
  - `backend/api/routes/snapshots.py` (API endpoint for grid data)
- **How to proceed:**
  - ✅ **Complete** — The grid now loads as expected. No further action needed for this step.

---

## 2. Verify Backend Data Flow
- **Goal:** Confirm backend endpoints are returning the expected data for the frontend.
- **Status:** ✅ **Complete** — Backend `/api/snapshots` and `/api/sources` endpoints return the correct fields and formats (`short_id`, canonical time slot IDs).
- **Where to look:**
  - `backend/api/routes/snapshots.py` (main endpoint for grid data)
  - `backend/api/routes/sources.py` (source metadata endpoint)
  - `backend/db/operations.py` (database query logic)
  - MongoDB: Check `headlines` and `news_sources` collections for correct documents and fields (`short_id`, `display_timestamp`, etc.)
- **How to proceed:**
  - ✅ **Complete** — Data contract is now robust and consistent.

---

## 3. Test End-to-End Integration
- **Goal:** Validate that the full stack (DB → API → FE) works for a real date.
- **Status:** ✅ **Complete** — End-to-end test for 2025-04-18 is successful. Images and headlines appear in the grid.
- **Where to look:**
  - `backend/tests/test_e2e_pipeline.py` (integration test)
  - `frontend/src/components/NewsGrid.tsx` (render logic)
- **How to proceed:**
  - ✅ **Complete** — End-to-end integration is working.

---

## 4. Document and Automate
- **Goal:** Make it easy for anyone to pick up and run the project.
- **Where to look:**
  - `README.md` (update with any new setup or troubleshooting steps)
  - `docs/NewsLens_Frontend_Integration_Plan.md` (integration notes)
  - `docs/Refactor_TODO.md` (remaining tasks and next steps)
- **How to proceed:**
  - Add any new findings, fixes, or gotchas to the docs as you debug.
  - Note any manual steps required for setup or testing.

---

## 5. Optional: Next Features or Cleanup
- **Ideas:**
  - Add more robust error handling/logging in both FE and BE.
  - Write more tests for edge cases (e.g., missing data, partial data).
  - Performance profiling for large data sets.
  - UI/UX improvements based on real data.

**Note:** The time slot ID format is now canonical (`HH:MM`) and consistent across backend and frontend. No further mapping is required.

When returning, start with the NewsGrid debug (step 1), and follow the data flow through the stack. All recent changes are committed and the codebase is ready for focused troubleshooting and further development.
