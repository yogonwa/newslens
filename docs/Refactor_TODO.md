## Pipeline Next Steps (TODO)
- [ ] Add retry logic for S3 and MongoDB operations using tenacity or similar.

- [ ] Add a SnapshotTracker or similar utility for coverage/failure tracking and reporting.
- [ ] Ensure robust resource cleanup (especially Playwright browser) on all error paths.
- [ ] Allow logs to be written to a file or external system for long-term retention.
- [ ] Optionally output a JSON or CSV summary of the run for downstream automation.
- [ ] Add enhanced validation for extracted headlines and for S3/DB operation integrity.
- [ ] Integrate with monitoring/alerting tools for high failure rates or performance issues.
- [ ] Complete documentation and runbooks for CLI, logging, and error handling.

## Architectural Improvements (TODO)
- [ ] Refactor Playwright page loading and capture logic into a dedicated service or utility (e.g., PageCaptureService) for better modularity and testability.
- [ ] Implement batch/concurrent processing using asyncio semaphores or task groups to improve throughput and scalability.
- [ ] Add structured logging and retry logic to all major pipeline steps for improved observability and robustness.

## Staff Engineer Best Practice Recommendation: Environment Variable Management (2024-05-XX)

- Centralize environment variable loading in a single config module (e.g., backend/config/env.py).
- Always load the .env file from the project root using an absolute path, regardless of working directory.
- Remove scattered load_dotenv() calls from submodules/services; only load once at the top of the main entrypoint.
- Use dependency injection for config objects in services, not direct os.environ access.
- Validate all required variables at startup and fail fast if missing.
- Document all required variables in .env.example and README.
- Never rely on working directory for .env loading; always use absolute paths.
- This approach is modular, extensible, testable, and production-ready.

### Immediate TODO (Blocking Backend Server Startup)
- Refactor backend to use a single, explicit environment loader as described above.
- Ensure backend/api/main.py (or main entrypoint) loads .env from the project root before any other imports.
- Remove all other load_dotenv() calls from backend/services and backend/config.
- Update all services to use config objects, not os.environ directly.
- Validate and document all required environment variables.
- Backend server is currently broken due to environment variable loading issuesâ€”address this as a priority before further development.

## Environment Variable Management Cleanup (TODO)
- [ ] Audit all modular libraries and their tests to ensure they do not load `.env` or access `os.environ` directly (except via `get_config()`).
- [ ] For any scripts or test files that need to be run standalone, add a top-of-file `.env` loader or use a test setup fixture as appropriate.
